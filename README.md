# Projeto1DSA - Projeto de Machine Learning em Logística Prevendo o Consumo de Energia de Carros Elétricos
This is a self-made data science project, included in a data science academy's course to evaluate my learning. The project is intended to fulfill a business need to predict the mean consumption of electric cars. 
Utilizing the concepts and techniques from the course, I search to respond to the question with the most valuable variables and applying know algoritms.
